# Code_refactor
Refactoring Horiseo webpage to meet accessibility standards.


## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```
## Work I have done

```
- Replaced non-semantic elements by semantic elements to clearly contents
- Allowed the organization of elements to dispaly a well structured code
- Used the image alt attribute to provide alternate texts for images
- Page title modified to be more descriptive
